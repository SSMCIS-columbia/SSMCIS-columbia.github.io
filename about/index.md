<h1 class="title" >ABOUT </h1>

Hi, I'm Vered.

I was taught math at school in what we called "The Columbia Program", (תכנית קולומביה).

This six-year program had been running since forever. The only thing handed down through the years was "it was developed at Columbia University", hence the name. It took some digging, over a stretch of time, to unpack why it was so different and how it survived. It was worth the effort.

The more I learned, the more dismayed I was at how quickly meaningful work can vanish. The Seconday School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study (SSMCIS) was an exceptionally ambitious undertaking. It's as relevant today as it was when created, at the height of the American 'New Math' era.

I am gratful to Nitsa Movshovitz-Hadar, without whom the key questions would have remained unanswered.
I also thank Asaf Ben Bassat and Asaf Zarmi, who added to my understanding of both the present and the past.

This project is in memory of Tova Libman (1952-2025), who was graceful in life and in math.
